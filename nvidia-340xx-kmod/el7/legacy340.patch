the above is the correct solution for redhat 7.4 using the 3.10.0-693 kernel. To provide more detailed steps, I've found the following works for the 340.102 driver and 304.135 (use patch appropriate for version)

1. make sure no nvidia.so file exists under /lib/modules/3.10.0-693.el7.x86_64 --if so, remove it
2. boot system into multi user mode from grub to the update 693 kernel (add systemd.unit=multi-user.target to boot line)
3. apply patch to nvidia installer; ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-304.135.run --apply-patch legacy304.patch --add-this-kernel
4. install driver using new custom installer ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-304.135-custom.run

if using the 340 driver, obviously use the 340 installer and the 340 patch file

To remove nvidia.ko, do not just delete it or rename.

sh ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-###.###.run --no-opengl-files add a â€“z if you have Nouveau bits that have not been blacklisted, < you have to specify no-opengl there are other files associated, so if it is still mentioned in /var/log/xorg.0.log you did not remove it correctly.

When it is no longer mention in the /var/log/xorg.0.log file you have successfully removed the nvidia.ko and associated files.
