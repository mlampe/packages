** ATTENTION **

An RPM packaged version of the NVIDIA driver is already installed on this
system. If you wish to install the NVIDIA driver using the NVIDIA installer
you MUST first uninstall the RPM packaged version of the driver. To uninstall
the packaged version of the driver, please run:

rpm -e kmod-nvidia

or

yum erase kmod-nvidia

and then reboot your system. It is then safe to run the NVIDIA installer.
